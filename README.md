## 🌟 Features

- **Totally based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym)**
  
  It's easy to use for those who are familiar with legged_gym and rsl_rl

- **Faster and Smaller**
  
  For a go2 walking on the plane task with 4096 envs, the training speed in Genesis is approximately **1.3x** compared to [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), while the graphics memory usage is roughly **1/2** compared to IsaacGym.

  With this smaller memory usage, it's possible to **run more parallel environments**, which can further improve the training speed.

## 🧪 Test Results

For tests conducted on Genesis, please refer to [tests.md](./test_resources/tests.md)

## 🛠 Installation

1. Create a new python virtual env with python>=3.10
2. Install pytorch for rocm
   ```bash
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2.4
   ```
3. Must use pip install; use newest Genesis will cause some error
   ```bash
   pip install genesis-world=0.2.1
   ```
4. Install rsl_rl and tensorboard
   ```bash
   # Install rsl_rl.
   git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
   cd rsl_rl && git checkout v1.0.2 && pip install -e . --use-pep517

   # Install tensorboard.
   pip install tensorboard
   ```
5. Install dependency
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JingXunLin/Genesis_Go2.git
   cd Genesis_Go2
   pip install -e .

   pip install open3d
   pip install pygame
   ```
6. Fix OpenGL error
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng

   Modify  ~/miniconda3/envs/genesis/lib/python3.12/site-packages/genesis/ext/pyrender/constants.py
   TARGET_OPEN_GL_MAJOR = 3  # Target OpenGL Major Version
   TARGET_OPEN_GL_MINOR = 3  # Target OpenGL Minor Version
   ```
## 👋 Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start

By default, the task is set to `go2`(in `utils/helper.py`), we can run a training session with the following command:

```bash
cd legged_gym/scripts
python train.py --headless --max_iterations=1000 # run training without rendering
```

After the training is done, paste the `run_name` under `logs/go2` to `load_run` in `go2_config.py`:

Then, run `play.py` to visualize the trained model.
```bash
vglrun python play.py --task=go2_rough
```
